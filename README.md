SQL for Data Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
To explore and analyze structured data using SQL queries on an e-commerce database (or another suitable dataset). This task demonstrates proficiency in writing queries for data extraction, aggregation, joining multiple tables, and creating views for deeper insights.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- **Editor**: Any SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver, SQLiteStudio)  
- **Dataset**: `Ecommerce_SQL_Database` (or any relevant dataset)

## 📂 Deliverables

- `data_analysis_queries.sql`: A file containing all SQL queries written for the task  
- `/screenshots/`: Folder containing screenshots of each query's output  
- `README.md`: This documentation

## 📝 Key Concepts Covered

### ✅ Basic Data Extraction
- `SELECT` specific columns
- Filter records using `WHERE`
- Sort results using `ORDER BY`

### ✅ Aggregation and Grouping
- Summarize data using functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Use `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` for meaningful summaries

### ✅ Joins
- Combine data across multiple tables using:
  - `INNER JOIN`
  - `LEFT JOIN`
  - `RIGHT JOIN` (if supported)

### ✅ Subqueries
- Use subqueries to:
  - Filter data based on aggregated results
  - Compare values between tables

### ✅ Views
- Create reusable `VIEWS` for frequent analytical queries

### ✅ Performance Optimization
- Analyze query performance
- Use `INDEXES` for faster lookups and joins

## 🔍 Sample Use Cases

- Total revenue generated per category
- Top 5 customers based on purchase volume
- Average order value per customer
- Daily sales trends
- Product inventory status
- Customers who haven't placed any orders

## 📸 Screenshots

Screenshots of each query and its result set are saved 
## 🚀 Outcome

By the end of this task, I was able to:

- Write complex SQL queries confidently
- Extract, filter, and summarize structured data
- Join multiple tables to discover hidden insights
- Use SQL views for reusable analytics
- Improve query performance with basic optimizations
